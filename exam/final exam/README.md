1. Observational data is what we perceive of the nature. Reality is what we will never know because it is always obfuscated with our biases and measurement uncertainties.  
2. Visualizing data: Mapping data onto aesthetics. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. The aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization are: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type.
3. The purple-green colors because people with color blindness will have a hard time with the red-green.
4. 1) qualitative color scale/intrinsic order. 2) Color to represent data values. 3) diverging color scale. 4) Color as a tool to highlight.
5. ????
6. Experiment, Theory, Computation.
7.  No. “The sky is rainy” implies that “the sky is cloudy”. However, rainy sky did not physically cause the cloudy sky.
8.  1) yes. 2) ???. 3)???. 4)???
9. Yes
10. ???
11. ???
12. Yes. One of the three fundamental desirata of probability theory is  Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.
13. ???
14. Git is the version control system. GitHub is a cloud-based service for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
15. Bayesian (and maybe classical if we are reffering to the degree of belief as well)
16. ????
17. I think it would be classical and bayesian because there is a degree of belief.
18. The height of the curve is scaled such that the area under the curve equals one. The correct graph starts at 0. Since the x-axis is about age, you cannot have negative numbers because you cannot have a negative age.
19. The computer can get overloaded and miscalculate is the number is too large.
20. B
21. Fortran  
22. ???
23. ???
24. Deductive reasoning: If A is true, then B is true. Plausible reasoning: If A is true, then B is more likely to be true.
25. It means they have the same truth value.
26. ????  
27. ????
28. The value of S is 1683.
29. ????
30. ???
31. ???
32. Human errors and the likeliness of occurrence. Sometimes human beliefs also change.
