3. Visualizing data: Mapping data onto aesthetics. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiablefeatures of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. The aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization are: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type.  
4. All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.  
5. The two major types of data are: Continuous and Discrete. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical we call it qualitative. Quantative- numerical. Can be measured or counted. Ex: height. Qaulitive: Categories or qualities. Ex: Dogs or cats (type of pets).  
6. The common name for variables holding qualitative data is factors. The different categories are called levels.  
7. Ordered data: Quantative, Numerical(age). Qualitive, Categorical(performance rating). Unordered data: Qualitive, Categorical(fruit types).

22. Puzzle: Matchstick Wrong Equation. If you move the bottom left matchstick from the "8" it becomes a 9 then take that matchstick and add it to the "0" to turn it into an "8" (9+3-4=8).
