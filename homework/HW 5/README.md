2. The three fundamental desiderata of Probability Theory are: 1) Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers, 2) Qualitative correspondence with common sense, 3) Consistency.
3. Visualizing data: Mapping data onto aesthetics. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiablefeatures of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. The aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization are: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type.  
4. All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.  
5. The two major types of data are: Continuous and Discrete. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical we call it qualitative. Quantative- numerical. Can be measured or counted. Ex: height. Qaulitative: Categories or qualities. Ex: Dogs or cats (type of pets).  
6. The common name for variables holding qualitative data is factors. The different categories are called levels.  
7. Ordered data: Quantitative, Numerical(age). Qualitative, Categorical(performance rating). Unordered data: Qualitative, Categorical(fruit types).

9. Good practice: represent axes with the same units with the same grid sizes. The example shows nonlinear axes. For example: temperature in different cities would be the same quantity but with different units.   
10. If the dataset was about the growth of bacteria population over time where the popuation doubles every hour, the best thing to do is to apply a logatithmic scale to the y-axis.  
11. My best guess is that the black grid appears to be the most valid because it is more organized and easy to read. Blue is valid as well.
12. 1) colors to distinguish categories, 2) colors to represent data values (sequential), 3)colors to represent data values(diverging), 4) color as a tool to highlight.  
13. The height of the curve is scaled such that the area under the curve equals one. The correct graph starts at 0. Since the x-axis is about age, you cannot have negative numbers because you cannot have a negative age.  
14. The first set of colors is hard to see by those who struggle with color blindness. The second set of colors (purple-green) is a viable alternative.

16. The four major schools of Probability Theory are: 1) Classical Probability, 2) Bayesian Probability, 3) Grequentist Probability, 4) Propensity.  
17. Puzzle: How many and what living creatures do you see? I see a frog and a horse.
18. Puzzle: Matchstick Wrong Equation. If you move the bottom left matchstick from the "8" it becomes a 9 then take that matchstick and add it to the "0" to turn it into an "8" (9+3-4=8).
