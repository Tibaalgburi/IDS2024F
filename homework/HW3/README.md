1. The three pillars of science are: Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.  
2. ???
3. The two types of scientific reasoning are Deductive and Plausible reasoning.
   a. Example of plausible reasoning: A ≡ it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest; B ≡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.
   b. Example of deductive reasoning: A= all plants need water to grow; B= rain provides water for plants. Therefore, rain helps plants grow.
4. The difference between observational data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena while observational data is information that is collected through observation of the natural phenomena. Reality encompasses everything that exists, observed or not. 
5. The three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid from bottom to top goes: Calibration Scenario:Scal/ Calibration Data:Dcal, Validation Scenario:Sval/Validation Data:Dval, Prediction Scenario: Sp/ Quantity of Interest.
6. A logical proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both.
7. ???
8. No, A⇒B does not necessitate B⇒A. For example: A= is it raining; B=the ground is wet. The rain can be the reason the ground is wet but it is not the ONLY resson.
