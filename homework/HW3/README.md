1. The three pillars of science are: Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.  
2. Three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences: computational science, biomedical, and neuroscience. Computational science is a branch of study that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex physical problems. Biomedical is the studies human biology, health, and diseases. Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system.  
3. The two types of scientific reasoning are Deductive and Plausible reasoning.
   a. Example of plausible reasoning: A ≡ it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest; B ≡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.
   b. Example of deductive reasoning: A= all plants need water to grow; B= rain provides water for plants. Therefore, rain helps plants grow.
4. The difference between observational data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena while observational data is information that is collected through observation of the natural phenomena. Reality encompasses everything that exists, observed or not. 
5. The three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid from bottom to top goes: Calibration Scenario:Scal/ Calibration Data:Dcal, Validation Scenario:Sval/Validation Data:Dval, Prediction Scenario: Sp/ Quantity of Interest.
6. A logical proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both.
7. No a logical proposition can not be both true or false because it can only be either true or false. So, it can be either a fact or something incorrect like "2+2 is 4" which is correct or "2+5 is 10" which is incorrect.
8. No, A⇒B does not necessitate B⇒A. For example: A= is it raining; B=the ground is wet. The rain can be the reason the ground is wet but it is not the ONLY resson.

13. logical implication and physical causation are NOT the same. For example: the rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am. Nevertheless, the proper logical connection is not in the uncertain causal direction (clouds ⇒ rain), but rather (rain ⇒ clouds), which is certain, although noncausal.  
14. If a person is crawling out of a jewelry store with a broken window and carrying expensive jewelry, then that gentleman is dishnest. Since B and A are true, C is true.  
14(a). The tiniest unit of information in computer and information science is a bit.
   b. 0 and 1 are easy to represent electronically.  
1. 2 different representations.  
2. 4 different representations.  
3. 8 different representations.
