   b. The chronological order of the languages is: FORTRAN, Algol, Lisp, BASIC, C, sh, C++, Fortran 90, Python, Java, JavaScript, C#  
   c. FORTRAN (1957. 50's), Algol 58 (1958. 50's), Lisp (1958. 50's), BASIC (1964. 60's), C (1972, 70's), sh (1979. 70's), C++ (1985. 80's), Fortran 90 (1991. 90's), Python (1991, 90's), Java (1995. 90's), JavaScript (1995. 90's), C# (early 2000's).   
2.  ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.
3.  Computers represent all information using integers because they store data as bits, which can only exist in two states: 0 or 1.
4.  The fastest part of computer memory is called cache memory. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.
5. The slowest storage device in computers that is typically integrated with computers is Level 3 (L3) Cashe.
6. The tiniest unit of information in computer and information science is a bit. A bit of information can either represent 0 or 1.
7. a) The closest programming language to machine code is low-level language. b) It does not need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible.
8. a) In the field of scientific computation, Fortran (FORmula TRANslation), first released in 1956, is undoubtedly the most influential programming language of all human history and the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active everyday use. b) Fortran was first developed in the 1950s. As of 2024, that makes Fortran around seven decades old.
9. a) Assembly language is a second generation language. b) These languages are from third and fourth generation. ("Examples of third-generation programming languages are: Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, C, C#, C++, Java, Pascal. Some prominent examples of this category (fourth generation include , Python, Perl, Ruby, IDL, R, S.)
10. C: 1970s, C++: 1980s, MATLAB:1980s, Python: 1990s.
11. An ancestor programming language of C is BCPL.  
12. The programming language ancestor of C++ is C.  
13. Ancestor of MATLAB: APL (A Programming Language).Ancestor of Python: ABC.
14. The fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers appears to be registers.
15. Typically, the smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers appears to be the registers as well.
16. Registers can be up to 100 times faster than RAM, making them the fastest type of memory available in a CPU.
17. RAM can be roughly 10 to 100 times faster than SSDs in terms of access speed.
18. RAM can transfer data at speeds of several thousand MB/s with access times in nanoseconds, while HDDs max out around 200 MB/s transfer speeds with access times in the milliseconds.
19. The primary roles of transistors in computers are transistors act as miniature electrical switches that can turn a current on or off and In analog circuits, transistors amplify signals, making them stronger.
20. The transistors had become so small that they did not function properly in the circuits; the circuit features became so small that their magnetic fields had noticeable impact on the movements of electrons in other part of the circuit, causing unnecessary heating and occasional bit flipping (A bit is the tiniest piece of data in computers).
21. The three tasks accomplished within a CPU cycle are the instruction fetch stage, the decode stage, and the execute stage.  
22. CPU cycles are just one aspect of overall system performance, and various other factors, such as cache performance, can lead to unexpected results in computing speed.
23. While CPU clock speeds are important, the slower speed of memory access, especially in relation to the speed of the CPU, often acts as the main bottleneck in achieving optimal performance in modern computing systems.
24. The Dennard Scaling implies that the more transistors we can fit on an Integrated Circuit (IC), typically of size 1 centimeters, the faster the CPU will become. The MOSFET scaling is the reduction in the parameters. Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.
25. a) 64 grains. b) 2080 grains. c) Approximately 0.3 pounds.
26. a) 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains. b) 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains. c) Approximately 2,635,391,195,257 lbs. d) Approximately 1,318 years.
27. The three fundamental components of a Turing-complete language are: Conditional Branching, Ability to Change State, and Ability to Perform Arbitrary Computations.
28. Exponential: plot of y vs x would be rapid and have a steep curve. Its plot of ln(y) vs x would have a linear relationship. Power: plot of y vs x would have a gradual increase. Its plot of log(y) vs log(x) would also have a linear relationship.
