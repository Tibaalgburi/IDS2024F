   b. The chronological order of the languages is: FORTRAN, Algol, Lisp, BASIC, C, sh, C++, Fortran 90, Python, Java, JavaScript, C#  
   c. FORTRAN (1957. 50's), Algol 58 (1958. 50's), Lisp (1958. 50's), BASIC (1964. 60's), C (1972, 70's), sh (1979. 70's), C++ (1985. 80's), Fortran 90 (1991. 90's), Python (1991, 90's), Java (1995. 90's), JavaScript (1995. 90's), C# (early 2000's).   
2.  ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.
3.  Computers represent all information using integers because they store data as bits, which can only exist in two states: 0 or 1.
4.  The fastest part of computer memory is called cache memory. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.
5. The slowest storage device in computers that is typically integrated with computers is Level 3 (L3) Cashe.
6. The tiniest unit of information in computer and information science is a bit. A bit of information can either represent 0 or 1.
