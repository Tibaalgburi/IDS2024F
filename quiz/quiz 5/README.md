1.??  
2. 1) Classical probability, 2) Bayesian, 3) Frequentist, 4) Propensity.  
3. Degree of belief- Classical and Bayesian probability.  
4. relative frequency of occurrence- frequentist probability and propensity.  
5. I think it would be classical and bayesian because there is a degree of belief.  
6. ???  
7. ???  
8. ???   
9. ???  
10. ??  
11. The uncertainty is that it could have been either or a mix of the two answers (a mule). We conclude that it is a mule.  
12. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiablefeatures of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. The aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization are: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type.  
13. All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.  
14. Variables holding qualitative data are factors, and the different categories are called levels.    
15. Continuous and Discrete. ???  
16. They are called factors.  
17. Ordered- Day. Unordered- Location.  
18. 1) colors to distinguish categories, 2) colors to represent data values (sequential), 3)colors to represent data values(diverging), 4) color as a tool to highlight.
19. Rotating a pie into the third dimension makes pie slices in the front appear larger than they really are and pie slices in the back appear smaller. Also, because the 3D perspective makes the plot difficult to read when it is showing morality rates.
