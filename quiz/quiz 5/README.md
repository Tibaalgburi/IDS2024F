1. It is a conditional probability or measure. the | means given.  "Pi of A given B".  
2. 1) Classical probability, 2) Bayesian, 3) Frequentist, 4) Propensity.  
3. Degree of belief- Classical and Bayesian probability.  
4. relative frequency of occurrence- frequentist probability and propensity.  
5. I think it would be classical and bayesian because there is a degree of belief.  
6. Bayesian inference is not a subset of frequentists. They are different. requentist believe relative frequency of occurance is probability while Bayesian probability believes in the degree of belief.
7. Classical and Bayesian.
8. Due to difference of opinion on what probability is. Somethings occur often others don't.   
9. Propensity, after 1940.  
10. Human errors and the likeliness of occurence. Sometimes humans believes also change.  
11. The uncertainty is that it could have been either or a mix of the two answers (a mule). We conclude that it is a mule.  
12. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiablefeatures of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. The aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization are: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type.  
13. All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.  
14. Variables holding qualitative data are factors, and the different categories are called levels.    
15. Continuous and Discrete. Continous- amount of rain. Discrete- number of students in a class.   
16. They are called factors.  
17. Ordered- Day. Unordered- Location.  
18. 1) colors to distinguish categories, 2) colors to represent data values (sequential), 3)colors to represent data values(diverging), 4) color as a tool to highlight.
19. Rotating a pie into the third dimension makes pie slices in the front appear larger than they really are and pie slices in the back appear smaller. Also, because the 3D perspective makes the plot difficult to read when it is showing morality rates.  
20. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative such as temperature. When it is categorical we call it qualitative such as Months.
21. Color is listed in orders and unordered in slide 5. Color is qualitative.  
22. Blue- each unique location on the curve grid can stil be assignef a set of numbers. Red- because it is a standard Cartesian grid.
23. The purple-green colors because people with color blindness will have a hard time with the red-green.  
24. 1)Houston. 2)Chicago. 3)San Diego. 4)San Diego.  
25... 1)qualitative color scale/intrinsic order. 2) Color to represent data values. 3) diverging
color scale. 4) Color as a tool to highlight.  
26. Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature, such that data values at one end of the scale can be logically joined to data values at the other end. 
27. Color as a tool to highlight.  
28. a)Increase. b)??.
